# Dotfiles

The dotfiles for my unix environments. Neovim, git, zsh, and tmux are the main tools I use.

### Sources of Inspiration

* TJ DeVries: his 'open open source' streams are really great, they're [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/TJDeVries/videos), dotfiles [here](https://github.com/tjdevries/config_manager).
* Upcase: tutorials by Thoughtbot—I learnt a lot from the git, tmux, and vim tracks, link [here](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase).
* Chris Toomey: the most prolific instructor on Upcase—I often grab things from his dotfiles, which are [here](https://github.com/christoomey/dotfiles/).
* Oh My Zsh: although I no longer use it, I have taken things from it when I missed one of its features—check out the repo [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
