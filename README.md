# Dotfiles

The dotfiles for my macOS unix environment.

Vim, git, zsh, and tmux are the main tools I use. I have [zplugin][] to manage zsh plugins and [vim-plug][] to manage vim plugins. [ripgrep][] and [fd][] are my searchers of choice.

[zplugin]: https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin
[vim-plug]: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
[ripgrep]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
[fd]: https://github.com/sharkdp/fd

### Sources of Inspiration

* Upcase: tutorials by Thoughtbot—I learnt a lot from the Git, Tmux, and Vim tracks. If you use [this link](http://ssqt.co/m5c5igy) when you sign up, we both get a month's subscription half-price. 
* Chris Toomey: the most prolific instructor on Upcase—I often grab things from his dotfiles, which are [here](https://github.com/christoomey/dotfiles/).
* Oh My Zsh: although I no longer use it, I take things from it when I miss one of its features—check out the repo [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

### Putting your dotfiles on github.

This excellent article [here](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/) covers all the reasons I decided to upload my dotfiles to github. It also explains how you can do it too.


## Notes to self

### Nix

When you install nix-darwin, it seems to create a /etc/zshenv symlink to a file in
its own `static` dir. As zsh always runs /etc/zshenv on startup, there's no need to
add anything extra (like the readme seems to suggest doing for bash) to get things
working.

The one thing you might want to consider doing is check there's no existing
`/etc/zshenv`, and if there is, making a backup, before you install.

## Versioning nixos

- System upgrade: sudo nixos-rebuild switch
- System rollback: sudo nixos-rebuild switch --rollback
- User upgrade: 
- User rollback: nix-env --rollback
- Garbage collect everything (sudo to include system builds): nix-collect-garbage -d/--delete-older-than 

- Autoclear to 1gb when less than 100mb space remaining:
nix.extraOptions = ''
  min-free = ${toString (100 * 1024 * 1024)}
  max-free = ${toString (1024 * 1024 * 1024)}
'';

note tmux paste-buffer shortcut for server (c-s ])

  'run manually:
  rustup install stable
  rustup default stable'

## Versioning vim plugins

Run `SavePlugSnapshot` before your run `PlugUpdate`; it will save a `.vim` file that
you can source to revert your changes.

Versioning vim-plug: this isn't really necessary, as you should only upgrade if it's
broken anyway (new features aren't added), but you can do so here if you really want
to: `https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/wiki/faq#shouldnt-vim-plug-update-itself-on-plugupdate-like-vundle`

## Versioning zsh plugins

Not supported right now by zplugin; but they have plans to add it, so wait.
Versioning zplugin: again, wait, hopefully their plans include that too.

## Browser

Use firefox sync
